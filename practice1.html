            <h2>Poem of William SHAKESPEARE</h2>
            <h4 style="color: red; background-color: lightblue"> Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h4>
       <div class="box-3">
     	<p style="color: red; background-color:lightblue";><b>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</b></p>
